You are given a doubly linked list which in addition to the next and previous pointers, it could have a child pointer, which may or may not point to a separate doubly linked list. These child lists may have one or more children of their own, and so on, to produce a multilevel data structure, as shown in the example below.

Flatten the list so that all the nodes appear in a single-level, doubly linked list. You are given the head of the first level of the list.

 

Example 1:

Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5,6,null,null,null,7,8,9,10,null,null,11,12]
Output: [1,2,3,7,8,11,12,9,10,4,5,6]
Explanation:

The multilevel linked list in the input is as follows:



After flattening the multilevel linked list it becomes:

---------------------Linked-List----------------------

"""
# Definition for a Node.
class Node:
    def __init__(self, val, prev, next, child):
        self.val = val
        self.prev = prev
        self.next = next
        self.child = child
"""

class Solution:
    def flatten(self, head: 'Node') -> 'Node':
        stack = []
        node = head
        
        while node:
            if node.child:
                if node.next:
                    stack.append(node.next)
                node.next = node.child
                node.child.prev = node
                node.child = None    
            if stack and node.next is None:
                node.next = stack.pop()
                node.next.prev = node
                
            node = node.next
            
        return head
